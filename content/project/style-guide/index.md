I'm the author of the [Vultr Style Guide](https://www.vultr.com/docs/vultr-docs-style-guide) and the companion [Vultr Markdown Toolkit](https://github.com/dfinr/vultr-mdtk).

The guide is purposefully basic because I found that the number of contributors plummeted when I wrote the first version. Vultr is trying to attract contributions from community authors, and I believe they were choosing not to participate because the program was intimidating. I streamlined the guide after a few months to create a balance that informs the authors without overburdening them. 

As a companion, I created a custom set of Vale style rules and vocabulary and bundled that with a preconfigured VSCode workspace and recommended extensions. I publish that authoring environment as the [Vultr Markdown Toolkit](https://github.com/dfinr/vultr-mdtk).
