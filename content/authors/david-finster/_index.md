I design business processes for small teams that deliver big results.  

I’m the Managing Technical Editor at [The Constant Company](https://www.constant.com/). Our most visible brand is [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), where I manage the public [documentation](https://www.vultr.com/docs/) library and [Trusted Author](https://vultrdocs.notion.site/) community. I'm an advocate for plain language and clear communication.  

Before joining Constant, I founded ProtectBits and spent 15 years consulting for government, business, and non-profit clients.
