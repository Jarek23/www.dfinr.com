When I broke the power plug in my Yamaha guitar amp, it took me a couple months to find the right part to fix it. It's not just a simple barrel connector like you'd find on most consumer electronics; it has an internal battery disconnect switch when AC power is plugged in.

After a lot of research, I managed to find the part. It's a Yamaha V5095000, which is a private-labeled SMK LGP7031-0300.
